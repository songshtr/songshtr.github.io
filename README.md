### what is a songshtr

<p style="text-align: justify">P.C.-based musician SONGSHTR had no choice.  He was not born with the <a href= "https://www.lyricsfreak.com/l/leonard+cohen/tower+of+song_20082815.html" target="_blank">gift</a> of the golden voice.  Instead, he was compelled to rely on the exponent of progress, on the power that was said to be compounding up and to the right, rising bit-by-bit up the graph-grid as software ate the world and hardware shat it out.  It had <a href="https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/" target="_blank">long been established</a> that a machine, when fed enough information, could learn to predict the next bit - thus discovering in its own brutish way the rudiments of language.  My <a href="https://github.com/songeater/SONGSHTR" target="_blank">first songshtr</a> was based on these discoveries, although it was a puny stringer of beeps-and-boops, an experiment that simply demonstrated the extent of its own futility.  Only by the spring of 2020, after the <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank">techno-psychological complex</a> had decided turn its ears to the problem, and after many moar orders of data had been digested by the cloud… only then was it <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00341" target="_blank">shown</a> that the machine could be made to croon.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">It has been <a href= "https://www.gwern.net/docs/borges/1947-borges-anewrefutationoftime.pdf" target="_blank">argued</a> – uneasily, as even the arguer admits – that the construct of time is refutable, and that every man is an illusion, a lie, just one in a line of lone and momentary men.  Yet each such blink and flash is a packet of information from which the next can be derived, and the previous too, and this entire chain is inescapable, it is ironbound.  So a man who lacks the capacity for making music at any one moment in time – through tin ear and flagging rhythm and soggy voice – has likely lacked such capacity the moment before, and will lack it in the ever after.  What hope then did I have but machine-craft?</p>
