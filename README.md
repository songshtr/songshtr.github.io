### what is a songshtr

<p style="text-align: justify">P.C.-based musician SONGSHTR had no choice.  He was not born with the <a href= "https://www.lyricsfreak.com/l/leonard+cohen/tower+of+song_20082815.html" target="_blank">gift</a> of the golden voice.  He was compelled to rely, instead, on the exponent of progress, which was said to be compounding up and to the right, rising bit-by-bit up the graph-grid as software ate the world and hardware shat it out.  It had <a href="https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/" target="_blank">long been established</a> that a machine, when fed enough information, could learn to predict the next bit - thus discovering in its own brutish way the rudiments of language.  The <a href="https://github.com/songeater/SONGSHTR" target="_blank">first</a> songshtr was based on these principles, although it was a puny stringer of beeps-and-boops, an experiment that best served to demonstrate the extent of its own futility.  It was only after the <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank">techno-psychological complex</a> decided turn its ears to the problem, and after many moar orders of data was digested by the cloud… only then could it be <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00341" target="_blank">shown</a> that a machine was able to croon.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">A <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Leibniz/quotations/" target="_blank">dead man</a> once claimed – in Latin no less – that music was an exercise in unconscious arithmetic, a counting in the secret mind.  More than a hundred years later, a <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38427/38427-pdf.pdf" target="_blank">second</a> dead man attempted a “higher view," parodying the claim by declaring that music was in fact an exercise in metaphysics, meant to count out the philosophies of the unconscious.  Another hundred years after that, a <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/arena-attachments/911407/e11bf56a7763d0a3f72d457ea00e779b.pdf#394" target="_blank">third</a> <i>morthomme</i> more generously summarized the aforementioned view: that music is no less immediate than the world itself is; that without the world and without the common stock of memories that language evokes, there would be no literature.  But music being detached from the world - there could always be music and not world.

<br><i>"Time is the tiger that mangles me"</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">In a separate piece, this third man also once <a href= "https://www.gwern.net/docs/borges/1947-borges-anewrefutationoftime.pdf" target="_blank">argued</a> – uneasily, as even he admitted – that the construct of time was refutable, and that every man was a lie, an illusion strung together from discrete moments, from a line of lone and momentary men. Yet each such blink of human was also a packet of information from which the next could be derived, and the previous too, and therefore the entire chain was inescapable and ironbound. So a man who lacked the capacity for music at any one moment in time – because of his tin ear or his flagging rhythm or his soggy voice – had likely lacked such capacity the moment before, and would surely lack it in the ever after. 
<br><br>
SONGSHTR had been born such a man, with dysmusia that allowed him to appreciate but never quite comprehend that underlying arithmetic.  His condition was perhaps not clinical, and could likely have been corrected early on in life through focus and diligent practise.  Yet here he was forty years later, and one distraction had happened to him, and then another, and his condition had remained unfixed.  What hope did he now have to escape his chain but the learning of machine-craft?</p>
