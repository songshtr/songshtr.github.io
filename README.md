### what is a songshtr

<p style="text-align: justify">P.C.-based musician SONGSHTR had no choice.  He was not born with the <a href= "https://www.lyricsfreak.com/l/leonard+cohen/tower+of+song_20082815.html" target="_blank">gift</a> of the golden voice.  He was compelled to rely, instead, on the exponent of progress, which was said to be compounding up and to the right, rising bit-by-bit up the graph-grid as software ate the world and hardware shat it out.  It had <a href="https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/" target="_blank">long been established</a> that a machine, when fed enough information, could learn to predict the next bit - thus discovering in its own brutish way the rudiments of language.  The <a href="https://github.com/songeater/SONGSHTR" target="_blank">first</a> songshtr was based on these principles, although it was a puny stringer of beeps-and-boops, an experiment that best served to demonstrate the extent of its own futility.  It was only after the <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank">techno-psychological complex</a> decided turn its ears to the problem, and after many moar orders of data was digested by the cloud… only then was it <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00341" target="_blank">shown</a> that a machine could truly be made to croon.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">It has been <a href= "https://www.gwern.net/docs/borges/1947-borges-anewrefutationoftime.pdf" target="_blank">argued</a> – uneasily, as even the arguer admits – that the construct of time is refutable, and that every man is a lie, an illusion strung together from discrete moments, from a line of lone and momentary men. Yet each such blink and flash is also a packet of information from which the next can be derived, and the previous too, and therefore this entire chain is inescapable and ironbound. So a man who lacks the capacity for making music at any one moment in time – because of his tin ear or his flagging rhythm or his soggy voice – has likely lacked such capacity the moment before, and will surely lack it in the ever after. 
<br>
What hope then did I have to escape this chain but through the learning of machine-craft?</p>
