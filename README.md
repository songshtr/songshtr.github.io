### what is songshtr

P.C.-based musician SONGSHTR had no choice.  He was not born with the gift of the golden voice.  Instead, he was compelled to rely upon the foggy coast, where the exponent of progress was said to be compounding up and to the right, rising bit-by-bit up the graph-grid as software took to eating the world, and hardware to shitting it out.  It had long been established that a machine, when fed enough information, could learn to predict what comes next - thus discovering in its own brutish way the rudiments of language.  Then by the spring of 2020, even more data had been digested by the cloud, and it was shown that the machine could also be made to croon.
