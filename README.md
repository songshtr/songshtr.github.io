### what is songshtr

<p style="text-align: justify">P.C.-based musician SONGSHTR had no choice.  He was not born with the <a href= "https://www.lyricsfreak.com/l/leonard+cohen/tower+of+song_20082815.html">gift</a> of the golden voice.  Instead, he was compelled to rely on the foggy coast, where the exponent of progress was said to be compounding up and to the right, rising bit-by-bit up the graph-grid as software took to eating the world, and hardware looked to shit it out.  It had <a href="https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/">long been established</a> that a machine, when fed enough information, could learn to predict the next - thus discovering in its own brutish way the rudimentary forms of language.  Then by the spring of 2020, even more data had been digested by the cloud, and it was <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00341">shown</a> that the machine could also be made to croon.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">It has been <a href= "https://www.gwern.net/docs/borges/1947-borges-anewrefutationoftime.pdf">argued</a> that every man is a lie, just one in a line of lone and momentary men.  </p>
