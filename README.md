### what is a songshtr

<p style="text-align: justify">P.C.-based musician SONGSHTR had no choice.  He was not born with the <a href= "https://www.lyricsfreak.com/l/leonard+cohen/tower+of+song_20082815.html">gift</a> of the golden voice.  Instead, he was compelled to rely on the exponent of progress, on the power that was said to be compounding up and to the right, rising bit-by-bit up the graph-grid as software ate the world and hardware shat it out.  It had <a href="https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/">long been established</a> that a machine, when fed enough information, could learn to predict the next bit - thus discovering in its own brutish way the rudiments of language.  My <a href="https://github.com/songeater/SONGSHTR">first songshtr</a> was based on these discoveries, but it was only a puny stringer of beeps-and-boops, an experiment that demonstrated its own futility.  Only by the spring of 2020, after the <a href="https://openai.com/">techno-psychological complex</a> had decided turn its ears to the problem, and after many moar orders of data had been digested by the cloudâ€¦ only then was it <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00341">shown</a> that the machine could be made to croon.</p>
